# GitHub Actions & CI/CD Standards

## Workflow Awareness
- The primary test workflow is located at `.github/workflows/test.yaml`.
- The container build workflow is at `.github/workflows/build-container.yaml`.

## Dependency Management
- **Runtime Dependencies**: Add to `requirements.txt`.
- **Test/Dev Dependencies**: Add to `requirements.dev.txt` (e.g., `pytest`, `ruff`, `mypy`).
- **CI Consistency**: Ensure that `requirements.dev.txt` is installed in the CI test environment before running tests.

## CI Steps
When modifying `pytest` commands or adding new linting tools:
1.  **Check Local First**: Ensure the command runs successfully locally.
2.  **Update Workflow**: Reflect the exact arguments in `.github/workflows/test.yaml`.
    - Example: If you add `--cov` to local pytest runs, update the CI step to include it or ensure `pytest.ini` handles it.

## Linting in CI
- CI enforces `ruff` and `mypy`.
- Do not disable these checks in the workflow.
- If you change the linter configuration (e.g., `ruff.toml` or `pyproject.toml`), ensure the CI workflow version of the tool is compatible.

## Container Builds
- If modifying `Dockerfile`, check `.github/workflows/build-container.yaml` to ensure build arguments and context remain valid.

# GitHub Workflows Security Best Practices

This section provides comprehensive guidance for creating secure GitHub Actions workflows, based on the [GitHub Security Lab](https://securitylab.github.com/) blog series on GitHub Actions security.

> **Note on Action Versions:** The action versions (commit SHAs and version tags) used in examples throughout this document may be outdated. When implementing these patterns, always check for the latest versions of actions and update the commit SHAs accordingly.

## Untrusted Input Handling

Reference: [GitHub Actions: Untrusted Input](https://securitylab.github.com/resources/github-actions-untrusted-input/)

### Always Use Environment Variables for GitHub Context Expressions

**NEVER** directly interpolate GitHub context expressions in `run:` scripts. Always encapsulate them in environment variables first.

```yaml
# BAD - Direct interpolation is vulnerable to injection
- name: Print PR title
  run: echo "Title: ${{ github.event.pull_request.title }}"

# GOOD - Use environment variable encapsulation
- name: Print PR title
  env:
    TITLE: ${{ github.event.pull_request.title }}
  run: echo "Title: $TITLE"
```

### Use Default GitHub Environment Variables

Prefer using default GitHub environment variables (like `$GITHUB_REF_NAME`, `$GITHUB_SHA`, `$GITHUB_REPOSITORY`) over context expressions when available:

```yaml
# GOOD - Use default environment variables
- name: Show branch info
  run: |
    echo "Branch: $GITHUB_REF_NAME"
    echo "SHA: $GITHUB_SHA"
    echo "Repository: $GITHUB_REPOSITORY"

# Also acceptable when env vars aren't available
- name: Show PR number
  env:
    PR_NUMBER: ${{ github.event.number }}
  run: echo "PR #$PR_NUMBER"
```

### Dangerous Context Expressions

The following context expressions are **especially dangerous** because they are controlled by external users:

| Expression | Risk |
|------------|------|
| `github.event.issue.title` | Attacker-controlled issue title |
| `github.event.issue.body` | Attacker-controlled issue body |
| `github.event.pull_request.title` | Attacker-controlled PR title |
| `github.event.pull_request.body` | Attacker-controlled PR description |
| `github.event.comment.body` | Attacker-controlled comment content |
| `github.event.review.body` | Attacker-controlled review content |
| `github.event.pages.*.page_name` | Attacker-controlled page name |
| `github.event.commits.*.message` | Attacker-controlled commit message |
| `github.event.head_commit.message` | Attacker-controlled commit message |
| `github.event.head_commit.author.email` | Attacker-controlled author email |
| `github.event.head_commit.author.name` | Attacker-controlled author name |
| `github.event.commits.*.author.email` | Attacker-controlled author email |
| `github.event.commits.*.author.name` | Attacker-controlled author name |
| `github.event.pull_request.head.ref` | Attacker-controlled branch name |
| `github.event.pull_request.head.label` | Attacker-controlled label |
| `github.event.pull_request.head.repo.default_branch` | Attacker-controlled default branch |
| `github.head_ref` | Attacker-controlled branch name |

**Always sanitize or encapsulate these in environment variables:**

```yaml
# GOOD - Proper encapsulation of dangerous inputs
- name: Check PR eligibility
  env:
    PR_BRANCH: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.ref }}
    PR_TITLE: ${{ github.event.pull_request.title }}
  run: |
    # Now safe to use in shell
    echo "Branch: $PR_BRANCH"
    echo "Title: $PR_TITLE"
```

## pull_request_target Security

Reference: [GitHub Actions: Preventing pwn requests](https://securitylab.github.com/resources/github-actions-preventing-pwn-requests/)

### When to Use Each Trigger

| Trigger | Secrets Access | Write Permission | Use Case |
|---------|---------------|------------------|----------|
| `pull_request` | No (from forks) | No | Build/test PR code safely |
| `pull_request_target` | Yes | Yes | Label PRs, comment, NO code checkout |
| `workflow_run` | Yes | Yes | Post-processing after `pull_request` |

### CRITICAL: Never Checkout Untrusted Code with pull_request_target

```yaml
# DANGEROUS - Checking out PR code with secrets access
on: pull_request_target
jobs:
  build:
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          ref: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }}  # UNSAFE!
      - run: npm install  # Attacker's code runs with secrets!

# SAFE - Only checkout target branch (default behavior)
on: pull_request_target
jobs:
  label:
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4  # Checks out base branch, safe
      - name: Add label
        run: gh pr edit $PR_NUMBER --add-label "needs-review"
```

### Preferred Pattern: pull_request + workflow_run

When you need to run untrusted PR code AND access secrets/write permissions, split into two workflows:

**Step 1: Unprivileged `pull_request` workflow**

```yaml
# .github/workflows/pr-build.yaml
name: PR Build
on: pull_request

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4  # Safe - no secrets access

      - name: Build and test
        run: |
          npm install
          npm test

      - name: Save PR number
        run: echo "${{ github.event.number }}" > pr_number.txt

      - name: Upload results
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: pr-results
          path: |
            pr_number.txt
            test-results/
```

**Step 2: Privileged `workflow_run` workflow**

```yaml
# .github/workflows/pr-comment.yaml
name: PR Comment
on:
  workflow_run:
    workflows: ["PR Build"]
    types: [completed]

jobs:
  comment:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.event.workflow_run.conclusion == 'success'
    steps:
      - name: Download artifacts
        uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: pr-results
          run-id: ${{ github.event.workflow_run.id }}
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

      - name: Comment on PR
        env:
          GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        run: |
          PR_NUMBER=$(cat pr_number.txt)
          gh pr comment "$PR_NUMBER" --body "Build succeeded!"
```

### When pull_request_target is Necessary: Use Author Verification

If you must use `pull_request_target` with code checkout, verify the author is trusted:

```yaml
on:
  pull_request_target:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened, ready_for_review]

jobs:
  check-commit-author:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    outputs:
      is_trusted: ${{ steps.check.outputs.is_trusted }}
    steps:
      - name: Checkout main branch for secure version of check action
        uses: actions/checkout@34e114876b0b11c390a56381ad16ebd13914f8d5 # v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 1
          ref: main  # Always use main branch for security-critical action
          persist-credentials: false

      - name: Check if author is trusted
        id: check
        env:
          AUTHOR: ${{ github.actor }}
        run: |
          # Implement your author verification logic here
          # Example: check against a list of trusted contributors
          echo "is_trusted=false" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT

  authorize:
    environment:
      ${{ (needs.check-commit-author.outputs.is_trusted == 'true' ||
          github.event.pull_request.head.repo.full_name == github.repository) &&
          'internal' || 'external' }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: check-commit-author
    steps:
      - name: Authorized
        run: echo "Author is authorized to run this workflow"

  build:
    needs: authorize
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout PR code (now safe after authorization)
        uses: actions/checkout@34e114876b0b11c390a56381ad16ebd13914f8d5 # v4
        with:
          ref: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }}
          persist-credentials: false
```

## Action Pinning and Permissions

Reference: [GitHub Actions: Building Blocks](https://securitylab.github.com/resources/github-actions-building-blocks/)

### Pin Actions to Commit SHAs

**Always** pin third-party actions to full commit SHAs, not tags:

```yaml
# BAD - Tags can be moved to malicious commits
- uses: actions/checkout@v4
- uses: docker/login-action@v3

# GOOD - Pinned to immutable commit SHA with version comment
- uses: actions/checkout@34e114876b0b11c390a56381ad16ebd13914f8d5 # v4
- uses: docker/login-action@9780b0c442fbb1117ed29e0efdff1e18412f7567 # v3
```

### Use persist-credentials: false

Always disable credential persistence unless explicitly needed:

```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@34e114876b0b11c390a56381ad16ebd13914f8d5 # v4
  with:
    persist-credentials: false  # Prevents token from being stored on disk
```

### Explicit Permissions Block

Always declare the minimum required permissions:

```yaml
# At workflow level
permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write

# Or at job level for finer control
jobs:
  build:
    permissions:
      contents: read
    # ...

  deploy:
    permissions:
      contents: read
      packages: write
    # ...
```

### Common Permission Patterns

```yaml
# Read-only workflow (most restrictive)
permissions:
  contents: read

# PR workflows that need to comment
permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write

# Package publishing
permissions:
  contents: read
  packages: write

# Release workflows
permissions:
  contents: write
  packages: write
```

## Environment Variable Safety

Reference: [GitHub Actions: New Patterns and Mitigations](https://securitylab.github.com/resources/github-actions-new-patterns-and-mitigations/)

### NEVER Append Untrusted Data to GITHUB_ENV

Allowing arbitrary input to be written to `$GITHUB_ENV` is extremely dangerous. Attackers can poison special environment variables that affect subsequent step execution.

```yaml
# DANGEROUS - Allows command injection via GITHUB_ENV
- name: Set environment
  run: |
    echo "BRANCH=${{ github.head_ref }}" >> $GITHUB_ENV  # UNSAFE!

# SAFE - Use env: block instead
- name: Use branch
  env:
    BRANCH: ${{ github.head_ref }}
  run: echo "Branch is $BRANCH"
```

### BASH_ENV Poisoning Attack

**CRITICAL:** If an attacker can write arbitrary content to `$GITHUB_ENV`, they can set `BASH_ENV` to execute code **before** subsequent Bash steps run:

```bash
# Attack vector - if attacker controls input that gets written to GITHUB_ENV:
echo 'BASH_ENV=$(malicious_command 1>&2)' >> $GITHUB_ENV
# Or point to a malicious script:
echo 'BASH_ENV=/path/to/attacker/script.sh' >> $GITHUB_ENV
```

When the next step runs, Bash will execute the `BASH_ENV` value before running the step's commands.

> **Note:** GitHub Actions runners execute `run:` statements using `bash --noprofile --norc -e -o pipefail {0}`, which does NOT load `.bashrc`, `.bash_profile`, or `.initrc`. However, `BASH_ENV` is still evaluated.

### Other Dangerous Environment Variables

Beyond `BASH_ENV`, attackers can poison other runtime-specific variables such as in this non-exhaustible list:

| Variable | Risk |
|----------|------|
| `BASH_ENV` | Executed before each Bash shell step |
| `NODE_OPTIONS` | Injects options/requires into Node.js processes |
| `PERL5OPT` | Injects options into Perl processes |
| `RUBYOPT` | Injects options into Ruby processes |
| `PYTHONSTARTUP` | Script executed on Python interpreter startup |
| `LD_PRELOAD` | Loads shared libraries before others (Linux) |

**Never allow untrusted input to set variables via `$GITHUB_ENV`.**

### Safe GITHUB_ENV Usage

Only write trusted, validated data to `GITHUB_ENV`:

```yaml
# SAFE - Writing computed/validated values
- name: Compute values
  run: |
    # Safe - internally computed values
    SHORT_SHA="${GITHUB_SHA:0:7}"
    echo "SHORT_SHA=$SHORT_SHA" >> $GITHUB_ENV

    # Safe - output from trusted command
    DATE=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
    echo "BUILD_DATE=$DATE" >> $GITHUB_ENV
```

### Use GITHUB_OUTPUT for Step Outputs

```yaml
- name: Generate output
  id: compute
  env:
    INPUT_VALUE: ${{ github.event.inputs.value }}
  run: |
    # Process the input safely
    result=$(echo "$INPUT_VALUE" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')
    echo "result=$result" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT

- name: Use output
  run: echo "Result: ${{ steps.compute.outputs.result }}"
```

---

## Artifact Security

### Treat Artifacts from Untrusted Sources as Untrusted

When using `workflow_run` to process artifacts from `pull_request` workflows:

```yaml
on:
  workflow_run:
    workflows: ["PR Build"]
    types: [completed]

jobs:
  process:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Download artifact
        uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: build-results
          run-id: ${{ github.event.workflow_run.id }}
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

      # DANGEROUS - Never execute downloaded binaries
      # - run: ./downloaded-binary

      # DANGEROUS - NEVER write artifact contents to GITHUB_ENV
      # Attackers can craft artifact content to hijack environment variables
      # and inject arbitrary commands via multiline values
      # - run: echo "DATA=$(cat result.txt)" >> $GITHUB_ENV  # UNSAFE!

      # SAFE - Only read data files and validate contents
      - name: Read PR number
        run: |
          PR_NUMBER=$(cat pr_number.txt)
          # Validate it's actually a number
          if ! [[ "$PR_NUMBER" =~ ^[0-9]+$ ]]; then
            echo "Invalid PR number"
            exit 1
          fi
```

### Validate Artifact Contents

**CRITICAL:** Never write artifact contents directly to `GITHUB_ENV`. Attackers can craft malicious artifact content with multiline values that hijack environment variables and inject arbitrary shell commands in subsequent steps.

```yaml
- name: Process artifact safely
  run: |
    # Validate file exists and is reasonable size
    if [[ ! -f "result.txt" ]] || [[ $(stat -c%s "result.txt") -gt 1000000 ]]; then
      echo "Invalid artifact"
      exit 1
    fi

    # Read and validate content - use in current step only
    CONTENT=$(cat result.txt)
    # Add validation as needed

    # NEVER do this with artifact content:
    # echo "CONTENT=$CONTENT" >> $GITHUB_ENV  # UNSAFE - allows env hijacking!
```

---

## Repository-Specific Patterns

### Concurrency Control

Use concurrency to cancel duplicate runs **from the same PR or branch only**. A new push to PR A should cancel the previous workflow for PR A, but should NOT affect workflows for PR B.

```yaml
concurrency:
  # Group by workflow name + PR number (for PRs) or ref (for branches)
  # This ensures:
  #   - PR A's new workflow cancels PR A's old workflow
  #   - PR A's workflow does NOT cancel PR B's workflow
  #   - Push to branch X cancels previous push to branch X
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.event.number || github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true
```

**How the group key works:**
- For pull requests: `github.event.number` provides the unique PR number (e.g., `my-workflow-123`)
- For branch pushes: `github.ref` provides the branch ref (e.g., `my-workflow-refs/heads/main`)
- Each unique group runs independently; only duplicate runs within the same group are cancelled

### Standard Workflow Header

```yaml
name: Descriptive Workflow Name

on:
  pull_request:  # Or appropriate trigger

concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.event.number || github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true

permissions:
  contents: read

env:
  # Global environment variables
  REGISTRY: quay.io

jobs:
  # ...
```

### Environment-Based Authorization

Use GitHub Environments for manual approval gates if `pull_request_target` cannot be avoided:

```yaml
jobs:
  authorize:
    environment:
      ${{ (condition) && 'internal' || 'external' }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "Authorized"

  deploy:
    needs: authorize
    # Proceeds only after environment approval
```

---

## Reusable Actions

### When to Create Reusable Actions

Create a reusable composite action in `.github/actions/` when:

1. Logic is used by multiple workflows
2. Logic is complex enough to benefit from encapsulation
3. Logic requires multiple steps that should be tested together

### Composite Action Template

```yaml
# .github/actions/my-action/action.yaml
name: "My Action"
description: "Description of what this action does"

inputs:
  required-input:
    description: "A required input"
    required: true
  optional-input:
    description: "An optional input"
    required: false
    default: "default-value"

outputs:
  result:
    description: "The result of the action"
    value: ${{ steps.main.outputs.result }}

runs:
  using: "composite"
  steps:
    - name: Validate inputs
      shell: bash
      env:
        INPUT_VALUE: ${{ inputs.required-input }}
      run: |
        if [[ -z "$INPUT_VALUE" ]]; then
          echo "Error: required-input is empty"
          exit 1
        fi

    - name: Main logic
      id: main
      shell: bash
      env:
        REQUIRED: ${{ inputs.required-input }}
        OPTIONAL: ${{ inputs.optional-input }}
      run: |
        # Your logic here
        echo "result=success" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
```

## Quick Reference Checklist

When creating or reviewing a workflow, verify:

- [ ] All GitHub context expressions are encapsulated in `env:` blocks
- [ ] No direct interpolation of untrusted inputs in `run:` scripts
- [ ] Actions are pinned to commit SHAs with version comments
- [ ] `permissions:` block is explicit and minimal
- [ ] `persist-credentials: false` used with `actions/checkout` where appropriate
- [ ] `pull_request_target` is only used when secrets/write access is truly needed
- [ ] If `pull_request_target` checks out PR code, author verification is in place
- [ ] No untrusted data is appended to `GITHUB_ENV` (especially `BASH_ENV`, `NODE_OPTIONS`, etc.)
- [ ] Artifacts from untrusted sources are validated before use
- [ ] Concurrency is configured to prevent duplicate runs
